          Did you know that between 2010 and 2020 we lost an average of 4.7 million ha per year?

          Or that over a fourth of all examined species are considered endangered?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a direct result of habitat loss, pollution, and climate change.
          These trends not only threaten wildlife but also endanger human communities
          hat depend on forests for clean air, water, medicine, and livelihoods. 
          By taking action now, we can reverse these trends and create a sustainable future for all.

          Conservation is essential for protecting biodiversity, which supports life on Earth by providing clean air, 
          fresh water, and stable ecosystems. It helps preserve natural habitats and protects endangered species from 
          extinction. Healthy ecosystems also play a key role in regulating the climate, preventing soil erosion, and 
          supporting agriculture. By using natural resources responsibly, we promote sustainable development and ensure 
          that future generations can enjoy the same environmental benefits we do today. Conservation efforts also help 
          reduce the impact of human activities like pollution and deforestation. Every small action—from recycling to
           planting trees—contributes to a healthier planet and a more sustainable future.
